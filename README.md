## My Story

I am Mohamed, and my journey into machine learning led me to explore the development of a voice assistant app and later delve into audio recognition. This project reflects my attempt to understand and build a chatbot, drawing on my experiences with LSTM and the challenges faced during development.

## Building MohamedGPT

Motivated by the desire to comprehend the inner workings of chatbots, I embarked on the journey of building MohamedGPT. The project involves training a text generator, experimenting with different model architectures, and overcoming algorithmic challenges.

## Challenges & Achievements

The development process was not without challenges. From algorithmic hurdles to refining the model architecture and addressing GUI issues, I encountered and overcame various obstacles. The README details these challenges and highlights the achievements made during the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with MohamedGPT, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your Python environment:

- Required libraries (list):
- asyncio: Provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines.
- tkinter: GUI library for creating graphical user interfaces.
- Entry, Frame, Text, Scrollbar, Label, Button, Scale, Canvas, CENTER, messagebox: Various tkinter components for building the GUI.
- threading: Provides threading support for executing multiple threads concurrently.
- random: Generates pseudo-random numbers.
- numpy: Library for numerical operations.
- pyttsx3.engine.Engine: Text-to-speech library for Python.
- tensorflow, Sequential, LSTM, Dense, Activation, RMSprop: Machine learning library for building and training neural networks.
- pygame: Cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- pyttsx3: Text-to-speech library for Python.
- os: Provides a way to interact with the operating system.
- Image, ImageTk: Classes from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing.
- Canvas, NW: tkinter components for canvas and positioning.
- threading, queue: Support for multithreaded programming.
- spacy: Natural language processing library.
- pyperclip: Module for accessing the clipboard.
- filedialog: tkinter component for opening and saving files.
- pytube: Library for downloading YouTube videos.
- moviepy.editor.VideoFileClip: Library for video editing.

- Background music file
- Image file for the GUI

### Installation

1. Repository Clone:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamedt4r29

   you will find it latter on my gGitHub!!!

### Usage
Once the GUI application is open, follow these steps:

1- Press the "Generate Text" button and wait for approximately 1 minute for the generated text to appear.

2- Use the "Clear Text" button to clear the generated text or the "Copy Text" button to copy it to the clipboard.

3- If you want to play background music while waiting, press the "Play Music" button. To change the music, press "Change Music" and select a music file from your PC.

4- If you don't have background music, press "Download Music" to download a music video from YouTube. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify where to save the music.

4- For predictive text, type the desired amount of text in the "Input Your Text" box and press "Complete Input." The app will predict the next sentence for you.

Enjoy the fun and engaging results!
